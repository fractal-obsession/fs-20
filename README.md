# FS-20

MS-20 like eurorack filter mopdule based on [KS-20](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2019/07/ks-20-filter.html) by _kassutronics_ based on the schematic published by Ren√© Schmitz.

Uses the LM13700 transconductance amplifier and it's buffer stage.

Includes:
 - KiCAD files for PCB and front panel
 - Custom SVGs for front panel footprints
 - JLCPCB-ready fabrication files

There are still some bugs and errors mainly on the front panel, but the electronics are correct.
